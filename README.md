# Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive guide to building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of rice leaf diseases. The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific part of the machine-learning workflow.

## Sections
1. **Installing dependencies and Importing Relevant Libraries**: This section installs the necessary Python libraries and imports the relevant modules for the project.

2. **Function to Load Images**: This section defines a function to load images from a specified folder and uses this function to load images of different types of rice leaf diseases.

3. **Preprocessing Images and Labels**: This section creates dictionaries to store the images and their corresponding labels, and then preprocesses the images and labels for machine learning.

4. **Splitting the Dataset and Scaling the Images**: This section splits the dataset into training and testing sets and scales the pixel values of the images to be between 0 and 1.

5. **Building and Training the Model**: This section defines the architecture of the CNN model, compiles it and trains it on the scaled training data.

6. **Evaluating the Model and Making Predictions**: This section evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset, makes predictions on the test dataset, and prints the predictions.

7. **Data Augmentation**: This section introduces data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data, which can help improve the model's performance.

8. **Displaying an Image Before and After Data Augmentation**: This section displays an image before and after applying the data augmentation, allowing you to compare the original and augmented images visually.

9. **Building and Training the Model with Data Augmentation**: This section defines a new CNN model that includes the data augmentation layer, compiles it, and trains it on the scaled training data.

10. **Evaluating the Model and Making Predictions After Data Augmentation**: This section evaluates the new model's performance on the test dataset, makes predictions on the test dataset, and prints the predictions.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project provides a detailed walkthrough of the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN for image classification, with a focus on practical techniques such as data preprocessing, data augmentation, and model evaluation. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in deep learning and its applications in image recognition.
